Electronic Cats KiCad Libraries
====================================

This repository contains a set of KiCad libraries that match the ElectronicCats-Libraries repository, as well as tools that can be used to manipulate various aspects of KiCad libraries and footprints.

**Electronic Cats DFM specifics**

The 'standard' libraries contain internal part numbers for ease of design. Some tools also exist, like the BOM generator, which are only useful with the internal part numbers.

*Note: By setting the field layer to white, the numbers become invisible*
